Last year this lecture used the moment generating function to work out
the mean and variance; this year we haven't looked at the moment
generating function and it isn't part of the unit so this part has
been changed. If you would like to learning about the moment
generating function you can look there. Last year someone else this
lecture for me so I prepared slides for them. You can also see those
in last years folder.
