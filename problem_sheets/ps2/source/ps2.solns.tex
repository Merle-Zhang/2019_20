\section*{Problem Sheet 2 - outline solutions}

\subsection*{Questions}

Four questions, each worth two marks with two marks for attendance.

\begin{enumerate}


\item The illusionist Derren Brown famously flipped a coin on camera
  so that it landed heads ten times in a row; he claimed that this was
  because of his mind powers, in fact it was because of his patience,
  he simply kept trying the trick again and again until it
  worked. It took him nine hours. What is the probability of a coin landing heads ten times in
  a row? If you flip a coin ten times what is the probability of
  getting five heads and five tails?\\ \\ \\ \textbf{Solution}: The chance of 10 heads is
\begin{equation}
p(10)=0.5^{10}=0.0009765625
\end{equation}
whereas the chance of five heads is
\begin{equation}
p(5)=\left(\begin{array}{c}10\\5\end{array}\right)0.5^{10}=0.24609375
\end{equation}


\item A fisher catches on average a fish every 25 minutes. What is the
  probability that they catche no fish in an
  hour?\\ \\ \\ \textbf{Solution}: If he catches a fish every 25
  minutes then his rate for an hour is 60/25=2.4 so
\begin{equation}
p(0)=e^{-2.4}\approx 0.09
\end{equation}

\item The distribution of tree heights in a christmas tree forest is 
\begin{equation}
p(h)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 0.3& 0\le h <2\\0.2& 2\le h<4\\0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
What is the mean height of trees in the forest?
\\ \\ \\
\textbf{Solution}: So 
\begin{equation}
\mu =\langle H\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^\infty hf(h)=\int_{0}^2 {0.3h}dh+\int_2^4{0.2h}dh
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^2 {0.3h}dh=\left.0.3\frac{h^2}{2}\right|_0^2=0.6
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\int_{2}^4 {0.2h}dh=\left.0.2\frac{h^2}{2}\right|_2^4=0.2 (8-2)=1.2
\end{equation}
so $\mu=1.8$.

\item Like the binomial distribution the geometric probability
  distribution is related to a series of independent trials where each
  trial has probability $p$ of success and $q=1-p$ of failure. The
  geometric probability $p(r)$ is the probability that the $r$th trial
  is the first success. It is
\begin{equation}
p(r)=q^{r-1}p
\end{equation}
It can be shown that 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r=1}^\infty p(r)=1
\end{equation}
as it must be. You can assume that here. What is the mean of the geometric probability? As a hint, this is done much as for the binomial expansion.
\\ \\ \\ 
\textbf{Solution}: So we have
\begin{equation}
1=\sum_{r=1}^\infty q^{r-1}p
\end{equation}
If we differenciate both sides by $p$ we get
\begin{equation}
0=\sum_{r=1}^\infty q^{r-1}-\sum_{r=1}^\infty (r-1)q^{r-2}p
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
0=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{r=1}^\infty q^{r-1}p-\sum_{r=1}^\infty (r-1)q^{r-2}p
\end{equation}
In the second term set $s=r-1$ to get 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r=1}^\infty (r-1)q^{r-2}p=\sum_{s=0}^\infty sq^{s-1}p=\sum_{s=1}^\infty sq^{s-1}p
\end{equation}
where we are able to change drop the $s=0$ term in the sum because it gives zero. Now back to the original equation:
\begin{equation}
0=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{r=1}^\infty q^{r-1}p-\sum_{s=1}^\infty sq^{s-1}p
\end{equation}
Now note that the first sum gives one and the second gives $\mu$ so
\begin{equation}
\mu=\frac{1}{p}
\end{equation}

We weren't asked to prove
\begin{equation}
\sum_{r=1}^\infty p(r)=1
\end{equation}
but in case you are interested it is discussed here
\begin{equation}
\sum_r q^{r-1}p=1
\end{equation}
For this we use the expansion
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{1-q}=1+q+q^2+\ldots
\end{equation}
you can think of this as coming from the binomial expansion of $(1-q)^{-1}$ using the generalized binomial formula discovered by Newton
\begin{equation}
(1+x)^n=\sum_r \frac{n(n-1)\ldots (n-r+1)}{r!}x^r
\end{equation}
with $n=-1$; it can also be derived as the Taylor expansion. Either way we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{1-q}=\sum_{r=0}^\infty q^r=\sum_{r=1}^\infty q^{r-1}
\end{equation}
and since $1-q=p$ this gives the result.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Extra questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Oranmore, the village I grew up in had more people with the
  surname Furey than any other village or town in the world. Since I
  left the village has expanded ten-fold and has gone from being a
  small village to a commuter town for Galway. However, when I was young
  one in ten people in the village had the surname Furey. Imagine
  there are 35 children in a class at school, what is the probability
  that five of them were Fureys?

  \textbf{Solution}: So this is just
  \begin{equation}
    p(r=5)=\left(\begin{array}{c}35\\5\end{array}\right) \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^{5}\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^{30}
\end{equation}
which is about $0.14$.
  
\item The \textbf{Fano factor} is sometimes used to describe distributions, it is
  \begin{equation}
    F=\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu}
  \end{equation}
What is the Fano factor for the Poisson distribution?

  \textbf{Solution}: We the mean and variance are both $\lambda$ so $F=1$.

\item The aim of this question is to use a similar argument to the one
  used to derive the Poisson distribution to work out the distribution
  for the time before the next event in a homogenous Poisson
  process. In the fishing example, it is the probability density for
  the time until the next fish is caught.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Say the next event occurs at a time $T$, divide this up into
      subinterval $T=n\delta t$ and write down the probability $P$ that
      there is no event in each of the first $n-1$ subintervals and an
      event in the final subinterval where $\lambda\delta t$ is the
      probability of an event in a $\delta t$ long subinterval.
    \item Now if the probability is related to the density by $P\approx p\delta t$ take the limit of $p$ as $n$ goes to infinity.
      \end{enumerate}

  \textbf{Solution}: For the first part, the probability is just
  \begin{equation}
    P=\left(1-\frac{\lambda T}{n}\right)^{n-1}\lambda \delta t
  \end{equation}
and so   
    \begin{equation}
    p=\left(1-\frac{\lambda T}{n}\right)^{n-1}\lambda \rightarrow \lambda e^{-\lambda t}
    \end{equation}
    as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
\end{enumerate}
