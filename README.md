## COMS10011 Probability and Statistics

This is the second time this unit has been taught; it will be
substantially the same as last year, since last year we, as in the CS,
department, has implemented a revision week, this means that there
will be two fewer lectures delivering new material and so the amount
of material will be reduced by a very small amount.

The lectures for this unit are Conor Houghton and Anne Roudaut.

#### Textbooks

The probability part of the unit is based in part on

*William Mendenhall, Dennis D Wackerly and Richard L Scheaffer. Mathematical Statistics with Applications

#### Exams and coursework

There will be five one hour work sessions, at each there will be a
sheet to do during the work sessions, this will be collected and
marked out of eight with two additional marks for attendance. The
average mark for these worksheets across the five sessions contributes
ten percent of the final mark, the rest comes from the exam.

There are past papers in the past paper folder, we will try to add
supplementary questions to the worksheets that mimick the exam
questions.
